Overview

This file contains the implementation of the redo and undo buttons for the whiteboard functionality in the application.
Key Features

    Provides undo/redo functionality for the whiteboard

    Ensures stable initialization of the Fastboard application

Implementation Notes
Fastboard App Initialization

The following line appears twice in the code:

app = fastboardSingleton.getFastboardApp();

This intentional duplication serves an important purpose:

    It ensures the Fastboard application is fully loaded before being used

    It prevents potential crashes of the whiteboard functionality

    The redundancy acts as a safeguard against race conditions during initialization

Usage

The undo/redo buttons provided by this component allow users to:

    Reverse their last action on the whiteboard (undo)

    Reapply actions they've undone (redo)
